# Portfolio Website of Johannes Ströbele

This is the portfolio website of Johannes Ströbele - designer, researcher, developer.
I worked at Europe’s fastest-growing tech unicorn Celonis.
My goal is to create software that enables users to make better decisions.

## What I learned:

* Creating a Flat UI web design that shows my passion for development 
* Developing a responsive, mobile-first project
* Using only HTML and CSS to maximize the accessibility based on the WCAG 2.0 Standard
* Repository on GitHub, domain from Namecheap, and deployment with Netlify
